\subsection{Time Allocation}
Understanding the resource utilization and the time allocation of the different parts of the sorting process is crucial to be able to optimize its computation time. However, the process has different points of constraint on different machines, as we will see in the following. \\
In general, high time consumption of the SAMtools \texttt{sort} method can be traced to three main blocks. In the following, I partition them in temporary files management, compression and Input/Output.
