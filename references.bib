	abstract = {Background
Genomic sequence data are not only massive but also increasing rapidly every day; therefore, it is essential to compress such data for sharing. Though there are some specific compressors, they lack interoperability. In this study, a SAMtools bgzip variant named 7bgzf has been developed, incorporating several compression and deflation algorithms other than the widely used zlib algorithm. An extensive benchmarking study has been carried out with available data compression software.
Results
On both x64 and ARM machines, igzip performed very rapidly. For high compression, using libdeflate on the x64 platform achieved high compression with tolerable speed loss.
Conclusions
Based on appropriate algorithm selection, the proposed compression method performed better than the original bgzip method while maintaining interoperability with existing software. Therefore, this software is useful for both distribution of genomic sequence archives and real-time compression in mobile computing.},

	abstract = {Since the original publication of the VCF and SAM formats, an explosion of software tools have been created to process these data files. To facilitate this a library was produced out of the original SAMtools implementation, with a focus on performance and robustness. The file formats themselves have become international standards under the jurisdiction of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health.We present a software library for providing programmatic access to sequencing alignment and variant formats. It was born out of the widely used SAMtools and BCFtools applications. Considerable improvements have been made to the original code plus many new features including newer access protocols, the addition of the CRAM file format, better indexing and iterators, and better use of threading.Since the original Samtools release, performance has been considerably improved, with a BAM read-write loop running 5 times faster and BAM to SAM conversion 13 times faster (both using 16 threads, compared to Samtools 0.1.19). Widespread adoption has seen HTSlib downloaded \&gt;1 million times from GitHub and conda. The C library has been used directly by an estimated 900 GitHub projects and has been incorporated into Perl, Python, Rust, and R, significantly expanding the number of uses via other languages. HTSlib is open source and is freely available from htslib.org under MIT/BSD license.},
